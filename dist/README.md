# React To Angular

Library for embedding React components in Angular.

Provides a component that takes a React component and a props object as input.

## Example

```bash
yarn install
yarn start
```

## Building

This project uses `ng-packagr` to bundle the module. `yarn build` will instead bundle the entire repository, including the demo app.

```bash
yarn packagr
```
